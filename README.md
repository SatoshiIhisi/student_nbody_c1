# Problem 1: Implement n-body Simulation
This repository contains a skeleton of an [n-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation) written in CUDA. An n-body simulation simulates the movement of asteroids or planets (bodies) by calculating the gravitational force between every pair of bodies.

0. Set up your programming environment. Ensure that CUDA and libsdl2 are installed. If both are installed correctly, you should be able to build and run the code in this repository.
1. Get familiar with CUDA. We suggest the Nvidia's [CUDA tutorial](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/even-easier-introduction-cuda/).
2. Fill in the `TODO` parts in `nbody.h` and `nbody.cu`.
